# Metydas_CSS-Library

A CSS Library made to work together with my personal design system.

## Purpose

The purpose of this CSS Library is to be used with a default design system I have created. &nbsp;

You can find an overview of the styles here --> (Insert link here). &nbsp;

This gives you the ability to use this library as you see fit and style your design system to it. &nbsp;

## Goal

The goal I have for this library is to learn more about CSS, SCSS and SASS than I currently know.&nbsp;

This library could not the that usefull to a lot of people so I suggest not using it in a
proffesional context since it is mostly meant as a learning tool for me.

## Usage

For the people that really want to use this library do the following steps:

- Download the "Metydas" folder and insert it in your project. (I have no idea how to setup so you can link in a header remotly and I am not planning to do such a thing)
- For overriding variables and such create a SCSS file and import the "Metydas folder" at the bottom. (It should only import the index file which includes everything)
- Make sure all your custom CSS is added above the Metydas import. (This is so that if you adjust variables they will be used instead of the Metydas variables)
- Your website should now be styled with the Metydas CSS-Library and your own CSS added.
